What I Learned

While building this portfolio website, I implemented a contact form that allows users to send messages directly through the site using EmailJS. Through this process, I learned how to:

Integrate EmailJS to handle form submissions without needing a backend server.

Use the emailjs.sendForm() method to capture form input and send it as an email.

Provide real-time feedback (success/failure alerts) to users after submission.

Ensure proper field validation using basic HTML5 attributes like required and type="email".

Securely initialize EmailJS using my public user ID, keeping sensitive information private.

Directly implement content from the GitHub README file into my portfolio website for clear documentation and consistency.

This experience gave me practical insights into integrating third-party services into frontend projects and how client-side JavaScript can manage contact functionalities effectively.
