ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
While building this portfolio website, I implemented a contact form that lets users send messages directly through the site using EmailJS. Through this, I learned how to:

->Integrate EmailJS to handle form submissions without needing a backend server.

->Use the emailjs.sendForm() method to capture form input and send it as an email.

->Provide real-time feedback (success/failure alerts) to users after submission.

->Ensure proper field validation using basic HTML5 attributes (required, type="email", etc.).

->Securely initialize EmailJS using my public user ID, keeping sensitive info private.

This experience gave me a practical understanding of integrating third-party services into frontend projects and how client-side JavaScript can manage contact functionalities.
